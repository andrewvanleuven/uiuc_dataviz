# uiuc_dataviz
R scripts and data files for ggplot2/dataviz tutorial

This repository contains materials for a seminar/workshop held on September 30 at the University of Illinois Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics.

The workshop covers the basics of data visualization in the context of applied economic research using the R programming language. In it, we learn six forms of data visualization:

*distribution, 
*relationships, 
*comparison, 
*composition, 
*connection, and 
*location

We also discuss how the R package “ggplot2” can be used to create attractive and efficient data plots to complement applied economic analysis. The demonstrations will feature real-world research and Extension examples from agricultural economics and regional science papers. Code and data are included in this GitHub repository so students can follow along during the workshop and eventually tailor the code for their own research purposes.
